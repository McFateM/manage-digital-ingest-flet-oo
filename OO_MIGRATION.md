# Object-Oriented Branch Migration

This document describes the migration of the Manage Digital Ingest application from a procedural to an object-oriented architecture.

## New Structure

### Directory Structure
```
manage-digital-ingest-flet-mp/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # New main application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                   # Original procedural code (preserved)
â”œâ”€â”€ views/                    # New views package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base_view.py         # Abstract base class for all views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home_view.py         # Home page view
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about_view.py        # About page view
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings_view.py     # Settings page view
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exit_view.py         # Exit page view

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage_view.py      # Storage view (placeholder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ log_view.py          # Log view
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ log_overlay.py       # Log overlay functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ logger.py                # Existing logger module
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                 # Existing utilities module
â””â”€â”€ _data/                   # Configuration data (unchanged)
```

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Base View Class (`views/base_view.py`)
- Abstract base class for all views
- Provides common functionality:
  - Theme color management
  - Logging setup
  - Log button creation
  - Abstract `render()` method

### 2. Individual View Classes
Each view is now a separate class inheriting from `BaseView`:
- **HomeView**: Main application page with branding
- **AboutView**: Application information and session data
- **SettingsView**: Configuration management
- **ExitView**: Application termination
- **FileSelectorView**: File selection (placeholder)
- **DerivativesView**: Derivative creation (placeholder)
- **StorageView**: Azure storage operations (placeholder)
- **LogView**: Log display management

### 3. Main Application Class (`app.py`)
- **MDIApplication**: Main application controller
  - Manages application lifecycle
  - Handles routing and navigation
  - Initializes all views
  - Manages app bar and UI structure

### 4. Log Overlay Class (`views/log_overlay.py`)
- Extracted from main application
- Handles log display in overlay format
- Manages progress tracking and cancellation

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Created object-oriented structure
- [x] Migrated core views (Home, About, Settings, Exit)
- [x] Implemented base view class with common functionality
- [x] Created main application class with routing
- [x] Extracted log overlay functionality
- [x] Set up proper package structure

### ðŸš§ In Progress / TODO
- [ ] **File Selector View**: Complex file selection logic needs full migration
- [ ] **Derivatives View**: Derivative creation functionality needs migration
- [ ] **Storage View**: Azure storage operations need implementation
- [ ] **Utility Functions**: Some utility functions may need migration
- [ ] **File Management**: Temporary file handling and processing logic
- [ ] **CSV Processing**: CSV reading and column selection logic
- [ ] **Image Processing**: Thumbnail generation and file processing

## Running the Application

### Object-Oriented Version
```bash
flet run app.py
```

### Original Procedural Version
```bash
flet run main.py
```

## Key Benefits of OO Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each view is self-contained
2. **Reusability**: Common functionality in base class
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual views
4. **Testability**: Each class can be tested independently
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new views or functionality

## Migration Notes

- Original `main.py` is preserved for reference
- New `app.py` provides the OO entry point
- All configuration files and data remain unchanged
- Logging functionality is preserved and enhanced
- Theme management is centralized in base class

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of complex views (File Selector, Derivatives)
2. Migrate utility functions to appropriate classes
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement unit tests for each view class
5. Add type hints throughout the codebase
6. Create documentation for each class and method
