  - **CollectionBuilder workflow only** - app is pre-configured for CollectionBuilder projects,

  - object file selection via...  
    - a system file picker pop-up, or  
    - ability to read a list of digital object filenames from a `CSV` file,  
      - coupled with a "fuzzy" network file search utility, and
      - automatic update of the `CSV` with unique object IDs, parent/child relationships, and revised file names/paths,
  - CollectionBuilder derivative creation utility (400x400 thumbnails and 800x800 small images),
  - `Azure Blob Storage` integration for CollectionBuilder collections,
